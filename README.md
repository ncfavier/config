This repository defines almost all of the
configuration for my machines running the [NixOS](https://nixos.org/) Linux
distribution, including installed programs, configuration files and running
services.

NixOS is built on top of [Nix](https://nixos.org/manual/nix/stable/#chap-introduction),
a package manager and build system with a declarative approach based on a
[lazy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazy_evaluation)
[functional programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming)
language. (See [GNU Guix](https://guix.gnu.org/)
for an alternative with a stronger focus on software freedoms.)

This repository is not meant to be used as-is by anyone else, but feel free to take
inspiration (see the [license](https://github.com/ncfavier/config/blob/main/LICENSE)).
